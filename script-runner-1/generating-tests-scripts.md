## Generating Tests

* Tests defined in test suites can be converted to be run by Script Runner through executing the generateScript.sh file located at automation-client⁩ ▸ ⁨runner⁩ ▸ generateScripts.sh
* Test scripts will be generated at linux, mac and win folder of the same runner directory
* Script Runner will pick up the bash scripts from the mac directory and run them through the server
