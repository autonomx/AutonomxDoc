Delete Projects
----------------

Katalon Analytics (beta) allows you to delete your existing projects. As an **owner** of a project or an **admin** of the team, you can click on the **Settings icon > Projects** to modify your existing projects.

Click on the delete button next to the project name, a confirmation dialogue will appear.
