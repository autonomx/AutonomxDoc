Role Management
---------------

### Default Roles

Katalon Analytics (beta) provides a set of predefined default roles for a project: Owner, Admin, and User. 

You can only delete a project if you are an **Admin **or an **Owner.**

#### Owner

By default, when you create a new project, you are the owner of that project. As a project's _Owner_, you can:

*   Assign _Admin_ or _User _roles to new or existing team members. 
*   Delete a project.
*   Invite new users to collaborate on your project. 
*   Remove existing _Admins_ and _Users _from your project. 
*   Upload test execution reports. 

#### Admin

When the project's owner assign you as a project's _Admin_, you can: 

*   Assign _Admin_ or _User _roles to new or existing team members. 
*   Delete a project.
*   Invite new users to collaborate on your project. 
*   Remove existing _Users_ from your project. 
*   Upload test execution reports. 

#### User

When you are first invited to collaborate on a project, your default is _User_. A _User_ can:

*   Monitor the progress of the project.
*   Upload test execution reports.

### Edit an Existing Role

As an _Admin _or _Owner_, if there is a specific permission you would like to enable for users who are already assigned a specific role, you can modify an existing role by clicking on the pencil icon in **User management.**

Remove a User
-------------

When clicking on the **Remove** button next to a user's name, the _Admin_ or _Owner_ can remove that person from a project. Once that user is removed, the _Admin_ or _Owner _can invited that person back in if necessary.
