### Status Report

The Status Report visualizes an overview of Test Execution Report Status over the time. This is the fastest way to get the status (so does the quality) of Automation Test of the AUT. Moreover, with the help of Filter function, the user can easily either get the information of specific Test Execution Status or all Status at the same time.

### Performance Report

Together with the Status Report, the Performance Report visualizes the amount of time each build takes. If the duration changes dramatically, it can be a signal of performance issue of the AUT and give the QA Lead a chance to fix the problem properly.

### Executions Report

While Status Report displays the status of Test Cases in each build, The Executions Report demonstrates the status of the whole execution over the time as well as the summary status of it. In other words, the table contains the combined information from Status and Duration Reports.

### Execution Detail Report

The Execution Detail Report provides detail information of the specific execution, including test cases list with specific status, test cases location, test suites and well as the environment detail where the test is executed.
