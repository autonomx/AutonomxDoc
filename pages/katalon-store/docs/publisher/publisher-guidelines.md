### 1.2. Banner

- Dimension: 726x388 px

- Format: png, jpeg

- A banner must include your plugin name written in title case and a logo.


## 2. Plugin's name in Store

- All of plugin names are written in **title case**. That means **each letter** except the first letter in the name is **lowercase**. All references to our products in text must utilize the proper case.



   Example:

  DYNAMIC FILTERING TEST SUITE ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

  Dynamic filtering test suite ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

- Use names that describe what your plugin does or that match your brand. 
- Don't use names that seem to indicate the app is built by Katalon. Your app name should never start with a Katalon product name (Katalon Studio). Instead, use the following pattern: **[Your plugin]** for **[Katalon Studio]**. 


  Examples of approved names: \
Dynamic Filtering Test Suite for Katalon Studio \
Themes for Katalon Studio
 
  Examples of NOT approved names: \
Katalon Studio Bug Fixer \
Katalon Studio Themes
