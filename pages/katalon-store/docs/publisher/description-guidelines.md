description: Guidelines to write plugin descriptions
---
## I. Plugin description requirements

- **Descriptions should be worded in a familiar tone** that uses proper, and not offensive, language.

- **Descriptions should not include information that is irrelevant** to the description of the plugin itself. For example, descriptions must not include information on pricing, discounts, deals, etc.

- **Descriptions should highlight the benefits of using the plugin features** **and must not contain only a list of product features** (such as a list of values separated by commas, or simply a bullet list of product features).

- **Descriptions should not contain any negative comments.**

- **Descriptions must not contain prohibited, banned, illegal, outlawed, or restricted content.**
