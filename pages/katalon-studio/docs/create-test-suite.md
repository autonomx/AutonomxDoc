A test suite is a collection of multiple test cases. In other words, a test suite contains all the test materials required to conduct a test execution. 

This article will walk you through how to create a test suite in Katalon Studio in the easiest way. 

Add a new Test Suite
-----------------------------------------

The most simple way is to go to File > New > Test Suite.

Fill in the name of the test suite and the description (optional).

Add a new Test Suite from Test Case
-----------------------------------------
Here's another way to create a test suite: Navigate to the **Add to test suite** button after you have finished scripting a test case.

There are two options to add test cases: 
- Add to an existing test suite (for you to locate the test cases in an existing test suite)
- Add to a new test suite (for you to locate the test cases in a new test suite)
