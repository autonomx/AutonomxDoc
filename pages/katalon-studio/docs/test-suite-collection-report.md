Once a test suite collection finishes its execution, a historical report will be automatically generated and stored in Reports. 

For example:

![](../../images/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-collection-report/image2017-2-24-203A483A52.png)

The report will be named with following the naming convention: _YYYYMMDD_HHmmss_, which is the datetime when the test suite collection starts its execution.
