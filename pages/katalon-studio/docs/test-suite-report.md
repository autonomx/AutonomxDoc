Once a test suite finishes its execution, a historical report will be automatically generated and stored in Reports. 

For example:

![](../../images/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-report/image2017-2-24-193A13A55.png)

The report will be named with following the naming convention: _YYYYMMDD_HHmmss_, which is the datetime when the test suite starts its execution.

Report Overview
---------------

In **Test Explorer** view, double-click on a historical execution of a test suite to view its details:
