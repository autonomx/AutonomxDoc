To help you get familiar with Katalon Studio, the Katalon Team has created various sample projects packaged with your installation and available on GitHub. 

When you open Katalon Studio, a **Katalon Help** page will appear. If you are not connected to the Internet, only the default sample projects will be shown. Otherwise, a link to Katalon GitHub repositories will be available. You can also directly access our sample projects [here](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples) and refer to this [guide](/x/foEw#GitIntegration-CloneProject) to clone the projects. 

Default Sample Projects
-----------------------

Katalon Studio provides 3 packaged sample projects, including:

*   WebUI Testing
*   Mobile Testing
*   Web Service Testing

Besides the Katalon Help page, these three sample projects can be accessed through **File/Katalon Studio > New Sample Projects**.

GitHub Projects

When you open a new session of Katalon Studio, if you are connected to the Internet, a list of available sample projects for you to try in the **Katalon Help **page. Just choose the one that you want to try out to import that project into Katalon Studio. Additionally, you can go to our GitHub repositories page by clicking on **Explore...**.
