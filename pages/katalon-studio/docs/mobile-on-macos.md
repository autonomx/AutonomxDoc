> Some emulators have already supported Appium through their installations. Thus, if you want to run an application on an emulator, check you emulator's settings before proceeding with Appium installation.

> Appium 1.9 is **not** supported, so please kindly install Appium 1.8.1. The installation command is:
> 
> npm install -g appium@1.8.1

### Android

If you want to test an Android application on your local device. You will need to install [Appium](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/#installing-appium).

1.  [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/vn/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
2.  [Command-line tool for Xcode](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)
