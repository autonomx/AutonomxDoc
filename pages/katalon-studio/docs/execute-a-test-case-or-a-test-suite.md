Katalon Studio allows you to run the entire test suite, or an individual test case. Before executing a test case or a test suite, keep in mind the [supported execution environments](/display/KD/Supported+Environments) by Katalon Studio. 

Execute an Entire Test Case or Test Suite
-----------------------------------------

Open a test case/test suite, then select the environment to run the test case from **Run** command of the main toolbar. You can also [execute the test case using console mode](/display/KD/Console+Mode+Execution).

> If you simply click on the **Run** button, the test case will be executed using the default browser defined in [Execution Settings](/display/KD/Execution+Settings).

Execute Parts of a Test Case
----------------------------

Creating automation test cases is a repetitive task that requires a lot of editing and re-running. In many automation tools, when the test case failed and the user makes certain changes to the script, the users usually has to execute the whole script all over again to make sure the test is executed as expected. To save users the trouble of having to run all unnecessary steps, Katalon Studio provides two ways so that users can start the test at their preferred steps.

### Execute from a Selected Step

From the [Manual view](/display/KD/Manual+View) of the test case:

1\. Start a browser in Katalon script using 'Open Browser' step. Else, you must have a current session running.

2. Ensure this browser's session is NOT terminated (**Project -> Settings -> Default -> Post-Execution -> Terminate...** options are unchecked based on your testing needs).

3\. Right click on one of the step you want to execute from, and execute the sesssion.

### Enable/Disable steps

Katalon Studio also allows users to disable one or more test steps before executing the test case as shown in the screenshot below. Using the shortcuts  Ctrl + D (disable) and Ctrl + E (enable) on selected steps, the users can leverage this feature to skip unwanted steps when executing test cases.

Job Progress
------------

The Job Progress will be triggered automatically to show the progress while your test case/test suite is being executed.
