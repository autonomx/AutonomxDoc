Thank you for choosing Katalon Studio. After installing Katalon Studio, you will be asked to activate the app using Katalon account. We recommend that you have an Internet connection on the computer that you are going to use Katalon Studio in. 

In some cases where there is no Internet access, you will need a computer with Internet connection to request an Offline Activation Code to activate Katalon Studio. 

Activating with Internet Connection
-----------------------------------

Simply provide your Katalon account to activate Katalon Studio.

### In-app Registration

If you have not registered a Katalon account yet, Katalon Studio allows you to sign up for an account right inside the app without having to access the website.

Once you have signed up successfully, Katalon Studio will automatically be activated.
