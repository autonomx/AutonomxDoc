Katalon Studio 5.8 introduces the new API/Web Service testing project. This significantly improved feature allows you to separate the API/Web Service testing procedures from Web UI and mobile testing - less confusion for your projects. You can also perform more API/Web Service automation tasks on Katalon Studio such as _Quickstart wizard_, _Import Swagger or WSDL_ definition File/URL directly, or retrieve _request history_ at any time. 

The update comes with a new interface, including a new toolbar and view that serve only for API/Web Service testing. To **create** the _New API/Web Service Project_, in _New Project_ dialog, simply select _API/Web Service_ type and specify all required project information.

Toolbar
-------

 The main toolbar contains API/Web Service testing related features only to help you navigate around the app easily and intuitively.

Quickstart
----------

To help accelerate the creation of Web Service request, Katalon Quickstart allows you to quickly create new requests or import request definition from File/URL with a single click.

Quick start options include:

*   **New Draft REST/SOAP Request: **Let you create a draft request to try out with various data before saving to the Objects Repository. All sent requests will be saved in the Request History panel. 
*   **Import [Swagger 2.0](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/import-rest-requests-from-swagger-20.html)/[WSDL](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/import-soap-requests-from-wsdl.html) from File/URL: **You can import web service definition from a local File or URL. Katalon Studio will load the specified information into its project. 

This API/Web Service quickstart starts automatically the first time you created a New API/Web Service project. You can launch it anytime through _Help_ \> _Quick Start_. 

[Request History Panel](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/request-history.html)
---------------------

Same with a normal Katalon Project, the left column now have _Request History_ view where all the sent requests are saved here. You can freely access and retrieve them to work or save as a request object in the Object Repository.
