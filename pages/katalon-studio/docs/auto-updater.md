Auto-update feature helps to ensure Katalon users are working with the newest version of Katalon Studio with latest updates and enhancements. By default, Katalon Studio will automatically check for new version everytime the application is started. 

*   If there is a new version **available**, Katalon Studio will display the notification with options as shown below
