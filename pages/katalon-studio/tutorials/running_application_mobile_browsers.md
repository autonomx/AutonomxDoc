What You'll Learn
-----------------

Katalon Studio supports executing the same test cases on both desktop browsers and mobile browsers. A test case created via recording, either in manual mode or script mode, on a desktop browser with Katalon Studio can be executed on a mobile browser as well. This tutorial will guide you step by step how to do that.

*   Understand your web application under test (AUT)
*   Create a test case with Katalon Studio
*   Execute the test case with mobile browser

What You'll Need
----------------

*   Katalon Studio: available for free, running on both Windows and MacOS with a beta Linux support. Visit [Katalon Studio website](https://www.katalon.com/download) to get the latest version.

Before You Dive In
------------------

First, you need to verify if your computer meets the [System Requirements](http://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/System+Requirements) of Katalon Studio.

After launching Katalon Studio, provide your registered username and password to activate this automation tool. The username and password are those used to login to [https://www.katalon.com/](https://www.katalon.com/). If you haven't already, check out [Quick Start](/katalon-studio/tutorials/web/get-started/quick-start/) to familiarize yourself with Katalon Studio.

Web application testing can be directly executed on a mobile device. To do so, the user needs to connect their devices/emulators into the machine and run the test scripts. We need to make sure that Chrome application (on Android device) and Safari application (on an iOS device) must be installed so that test steps can execute properly.

It is not an easy task and requires some knowledge on working with OS, Appium, and the device in use. Many people cannot implement this flow successfully because facing some issues in this task. Please refer to our Mobile Setup guide [for Windows](/x/jwbR) or [for macOS](/x/9AXR) and follow the instructions closely.

Understand your web application under test (AUT)
------------------------------------------------

When a smartphone is a must-have for everyone, it is required for a web application to accommodate both desktop browsers and mobile browsers.

Often, a desktop UI and a mobile web UI will vary for the same web application since the screen of a desktop is different from that of a phone (in resolution, size, ratio, for example). Thus, a web application with responsive implementation will be able to adapt to various devices. This might cause a problem during the quality assurance period. The same element in different implementation for desktop and mobile may have different locators, and this fact alone can prevent our test cases from executing correctly on mobile browser.

Do not stress out when your test cases cannot execute properly on mobile browsers as they do on desktop browsers. Automation testing is all about understanding the AUT (Application Under Test) clearly to find a suitable approach. This practice should be a top priority before we want to continue testing our web application.

Create a test case with Katalon Studio
--------------------------------------

After understanding your AUT, and you have decided to perform automation testing, let's create a test case with Katalon Studio. Below is the test scenario and how to create the test case in manual mode.

### Scenario: Login

Step 1: Launch Chrome browser in mobile.

Step 2: Enter valid username and password.

Step 3: Click on the login button.

Step 4: Verify login is successful.

### Manual Mode

Step 1: Click on Add from Toolbar and select Web UI Keyword.

![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/running_application_mobile_browsers/MobileBrowsers1.png)

Step 2: Select _Open Browser_ and pass the URL in the input field. Call _Wait for Page to Load_ and provide a timeout value in the input field.

Step 3: Add _Wait for Element Visible_ keyword for button object "Make Appointment."

Step 4: Before performing the click action, Verify whether the element is clickable using _Verify Element Clickable_ keyword, pass the object button "Make Appointment."

Step 5: Call _Click_ action to be performed on the "Make Appointment" button

Step 6: _Wait for Element Visible_ "Login."

Step 7: Add _Verify Element Clickable_ and pass the object as the "Login" button.

Step 8: _Set Text_ for username as "John Doe"

Step 9:  _Set Text_ in the password as "ThisIsNotAPassword"

Step 10: Add _Click_ action to be performed on the Login button.

Step 11: _Wait for Element_ present of text "Make Appointment".

Step12: Add _Get Text_ keyword to capture the Header "Make Appointment" and store it in a variable called "actual_Header".

Step 13: Use the _Verify Match_ Keyword to verify the actual and expected texts.

Step 14: Close the browser.

You can also achieve the desired test case by using **Script Mode**.

### Script Mode

```groovy
import static com.kms.katalon.core.testobject.ObjectRepository.findTestObject
import com.kms.katalon.core.model.FailureHandling as FailureHandling
import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI
 
'Launch Browser'
WebUI.openBrowser('http://demoaut.katalon.com/')
 
'Wait for Page Load'
WebUI.waitForPageLoad(30)
 
'Wait for Element Visible of Button Make Appointment'
WebUI.waitForElementVisible(findTestObject('Browser Application/button_Make Appointment'), 30)
 
'Verify Button Make Appointment is clickable or not'
WebUI.verifyElementClickable(findTestObject('Browser Application/button_Make Appointment'), FailureHandling.STOP_ON_FAILURE)
 
'Click on Button Make Appointment'
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Browser Application/button_Make Appointment'))
 
'Wait for text login Header '
WebUI.waitForElementVisible(findTestObject('Browser Application/text_Login Header'), 30)
 
'Verify text login Header is in visible '
WebUI.verifyElementVisible(findTestObject('Browser Application/text_Login Header'))
 
'Enter username as "John Doe"'
WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Browser Application/txt_UserName'), 'John Doe')
 
'Enter password as "ThisIsNotAPassword"'
WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Browser Application/txt_Password'), 'ThisIsNotAPassword')
 
'Click on Login Button'
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Browser Application/button_Login'))
 
'Wait for Element Present of "Header Make Appointment"'
WebUI.waitForElementPresent(findTestObject('Browser Application/text_Header Make Appointment'), 30)
 
'Get the Header text of Make Appointment and store in "actual_Header" variable'
actual_Header = WebUI.getText(findTestObject('Browser Application/text_Header Make Appointment'))
 
'Verify the actual and Expected text'
WebUI.verifyMatch(actual_Header, 'Make Appointment', false)
 
'Close the Broswer'
WebUI.closeBrowser()

```

Do not forget to execute the test case in Katalon Studio again to ensure that it works properly.

Execute the test case with mobile browser
-----------------------------------------

Double check again to ensure that the real device is connected, or virtual device is loaded, or cloud device is connected successfully. From Katalon Studio, select the test case and choose to execute with Android/iOS as follows:

![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/running_application_mobile_browsers/MobileBrowsers3.png)

It may take a while before the browser can be loaded into the device.
