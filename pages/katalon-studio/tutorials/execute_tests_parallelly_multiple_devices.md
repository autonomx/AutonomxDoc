There are instances in which the user wants to execute tests on different devices at the same time. Below is the how-to guide for these instances.

*   Step 1: Create **two** Test suites. Refer to the [Katalon documentatio](/x/mAvR)[n](/x/7AAM) for a quick guide to creating test suites.
*   Step 2: Create **one** Test Suite Collection. Refer to the [Katalon documentation](/x/NgvR) for a quick guide to creating test suite collections.
*   Step 3: When we add a test suite a test suite collection, by default, the execution will be running on Firefox browser. The user can change their desired browsers as needed.

*   Step 9: Select the radio button '**Parallel**' in the **Execution Information** section.
*   Step 10: Click on **Execute**. It will execute tests parallelly on your selected mobile devices.
