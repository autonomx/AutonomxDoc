### Introduction

This Getting Started Guide gives you a quick introduction to Katalon Studio, from downloading to activation and running your first automation test.

### Download Katalon Studio

Katalon Studio is available for free, supporting both Windows and Mac. Visit [Katalon Studio website](https://www.katalon.com/) to download the latest version.

### Environment Configuration

First you need to verify if your computer meets the [System Requirements](http://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/System+Requirements) of Katalon Studio.

- If you do **Web UI** testing, then no additional settings are needed except making sure the required browsers are installed. Check [this list](/x/dAAM) for all supported browsers.

- In case of **Mobile** testing, you need to install **Node.js, Appium** and enable **USB Debugging mode** on your device first. Please refer to [Installation Guide](http://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/Installation+and+Setup) for more details.

### Start Katalon Studio

To start Katalon Studio, double-click on the **katalon.exe** (Microsoft Windows) or **katalon** (Mac) file in the directory where you unpack Katalon Studio.

Once started, the application should display a splash screen.

### Activate Katalon Build

After launching Katalon Studio, provide your registered username and password to activate your Katalon Studio Instance. The username and password are the ones used to login to [https://www.katalon.com](https://www.katalon.com)

### Feature Introduction

When your build is activated, the **Quick Guide** screen is displayed to guide you through all major features. You can skip this and view the Quick Guide later from the **Help** menu.

At the end of the introduction, Katalon Studio suggests to create a new project. Click **OK**.

### Create a Project

Enter the name of your new project and the location to store the project data on your machine. Click **OK**.

A new project will be generated at specified location.

### Create your first Test Case

–  Select option to create **New Test Case** from the main Toolbar.

–  Provide the name for your test case then click **OK**.

–  A new test case will be created accordingly. The test case editor is also displayed for editing.

–  You can compose the test case by recording, scripting or manually entering test steps. For now, let's quickly generate the test script using **Record** feature. Click on the **Record** icon from the main Toolbar.

–  Click **Record** to launch the browser. During recording, actions performed on the browser will be captured and be generated into test steps.

_Note: You can specify the target browser to be launched by selecting from the Record dropdownlist._

–  Let's create a simple script by going to Google Search and lookup for some keywords as illustrated on the screen above. Click **OK** of **Record** dialog when you finish recording.

–  You are prompted to confirm saving all captured objects to Katalon Studio. Click **OK**.

–  Captured actions and objects are generated in Katalon Studio.

–  Now you can click on **Run** command from the main Toolbar to execute the script.

_Note: You can specify the target browser to run the script by selecting it in the Run dropdown list._

Congratulations! You have just successfully created and executed your first test case.
