What are Desired Capabilities?
------------------------------

Desired Capabilities was introduced in Selenium to work with various browser capabilities such as handling browser cookies, SSL security popup, and other preferences of users.

Why Utilizing Desired Capabilities?
-----------------------------------

Through using Desired Capabilities, we can communicate with Appium server by sending a POST request. For example, a user would like to run mobile test with a preferred platform, browser, orientation of the app, etc. If the user has already set the desired capability preferences setting, Appium server will start a session with the capabilities that user has set initially.

Desired capabilities is a JSON object (having keys and values pair). Within each desired capability, there are few inbuilt capabilities. We need to set the capability **name** as '**key**' and **capability** value as '**value**'. The capabilities keys are **case-sensitive**.

Setting up Desired Capabilities for Mobile
------------------------------------------

*   From the '**Project**' dropdown of Katalon Studio main toolbar, click on **Settings**

*   After clicking on Android, it will display a screen with a dropdown with **Device Name** and **Add**, **Delete**, **Clear** buttons. Steps to **add** a property for execution are as following:
*   Click **Add** button of command toolbar above the **Desired Capabilities** list.
