Submit issue to JIRA

The bug submission options include:

<table>

        <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Create as New</td>
            <td>A new Issue will be submitted to JIRA.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Create as Sub Issue</td>
            <td>
                A sub-task for an existing JIRA issue will be created. You will be asked to provide the <b>ID</b> of the existing JIRA issue to create a sub-task within.
                <p></p>
                <p><img src="../../images/katalon-studio/docs/working-with-jira/image2017-8-2-163A123A21.png"></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Link to existing Issue</td>
            <td>
                This option will append execution details to an existing JIRA issue. You will be asked to provide the ID of the existing JIRA issue for this.
                <p></p>
                <p><img src="../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/Link-to-existing-Issue.png"></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

4\. In case of creating a new JIRA issue (or Sub-task), a **JIRA native submission form** will be displayed. The following is an example form for creating a new JIRA issue:
![JIRA native submission form](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/JIRA-native-submission-form.png)

5\. Based on your preferences in [JIRA Integration settings](/display/KD/JIRA+Integration#JIRAIntegration-Configuration), the **Summary**, **Screenshots**, **Logs, Reporter, and Description** of test cases will be populated and attached accordingly. Once done, click on the **Create** button at bottom of the form.

6\. A created **JIRA issue** will have its **ID** recorded in the **Linked JIRA issues** list so that you can quickly navigate there from Katalon Studio. You can also edit linked JIRA issue or remove the linking of the created JIRA issue.![Linked JIRA issues](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/Linked-JIRA-issues1.png)

Once clicked on **ID**, you will be taken to **JIRA issues** page accordingly as shown below
