Test Case
---------

Introduce **Properties** tab for Test Case. The read-only **Comment** field, whose value is extracted from [Comment](/display/KD/%5BCommon%5D+Comment) keywords, allows users to annotate their automation script for reviewing purpose. The below screenshot showcases how BDD and its Gherkin syntax is leverage to give description for the test case. Thus, allow business stakeholders such as BA or PM to involve in development process.
