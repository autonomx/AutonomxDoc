Introducing Script View for [Execution Profiles](../../katalon-studio/docs/execution-profile-v54.html) and [Variables](../../katalon-studio/docs/variable-types.html)
-------------------
The Script View is provided with an XML editor to allow you to reuse and sync any set of variables easily, whether in Execution Profiles or in the Test Case. Just a few simple actions and the tests can be run with different data for cross-environment testing.

[Enhanced Console and Log Viewer](../../katalon-studio/docs/working-with-execution-log.html)
--------------------
Debugging becomes easier in Katalon Studio 5.9. We've optimized the execution logs to give you comprehensive views of what happens during your test automation. The following changes are applied to both Console and Log Viewer:

- Make default font size smaller for code and logs (based on Eclipse settings)
- Remove JSON logs
- Simplify log messages
- Simplify the tree viewer

### New Status Bar in Log Viewer (FKA Progress Bar)
Instantly know your test execution status with the New Status Bar in Log Viewer. The Status Bar has two color: GREEN and RED to indicate the test run PASSED or FAILED/ERROR status respectively. 


### Added Log properties file to custom log levels
Sometimes more details execution log is needed to troubleshoot runtime issues. A log properties file is added to _Include_ folder in Tests Explorer allowing you to adjust the logging levels of Katalon Studio. There are DEBUGGING level and TRACE level. Debugging level will be set by default. TRACE level is the lowest log level and will display the most details log information.

### Added HAR file to Web Service request Console Log
In version 5.9, Katalon Studio provides HAR file in the Console Log of APIs/Web Service request. The HAR file contains low-level data to quickly help you identify the key performance problems with Web services. Therefore, the project team can allocate development resource efficiently. Data in HAR file is stored in JSON format.
