Test Design 
------------

### Sensitive Text Encryption

Privacy and Security are crucial than ever to the software industry. **Text encryption** feature is introduced via the built-in "**[setEncryptedText](/x/6AHR)**" keyword. It allows users to encrypt any sensitive text right in the test case and capable to decrypt on-the-fly at runtime. Thus, the project team can collaborate and share test artifacts among members and stakeholder without any security concerns.

Test Execution
--------------

### Execution Profile

> **Global Variables** interface is moved to be a **default profile,** so please check **'default' profile** for any existing **Global Variables** 

Test execution is more versatile in Katalon Studio v5.4. Automation tests can be executed dynamically by configurable **profiles**, defined by a combination of multiple attributes (environments, test data, platforms). **Execution profiles** enable Functional and API test execution integrated into the CI pipeline regardless of the test requirement complexity to meet the rapid demand of Agile software project.
