Improved Web Recorder
---------------------

The new Web Recorder will have a similar interface to Test Case View. With the new Recorder, you can:

*   Continue recording existing test cases to minimize the hassle of re-recording long and complex tests.
*   Edit test cases during recording so that the recording process can be optimized. 
*   Run test steps in the Recorder interface, making sure the recorded steps are executable.
*   Merge and override test objects after recording, optimizing the object repositories.

Beginner Friendly
-----------------

We've been working hard to make additional sample projects on our public [Katalon GitHub repository](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples). The Welcome page will list all of these projects automatically and you can select which sample project you would like to refer. The Katalon Team aims to give you a richer experience with Katalon Studio by utilizing these dynamic sample projects, along with the lists of [Tips and Tricks](/x/PgXR) that we have curated.
