Test Object
-----------

**[Parameterizing Test Objects](/display/KD/Manage+Test+Object#ManageTestObject-ParameterizingTestObject)**

This version provides the capability to handle dynamic objects (objects with particular properties changed due to certain business rules). Users can leverage Katalon Studio parameterization capability to control these objects easily.
For example, the desired properties for the test object can be declared in the manual mode even without recording & spying the AUT. These properties will be used by Katalon to identify the test object during execution dynamically.

Users can leverage the declared properties further by using Katalon scripting mode and adjust how the value of the properties to be perceived. (Typically, users will want to pass property value as variable or make reference to datafiles according to their situation - Refer to [Parameterizing Test Object](/display/KD/Manage+Test+Object#ManageTestObject-ParameterizingTestObject) for more details).
