### **Support Skip Test Case method in Test Listener**
to help skip running any undesired Test Cases. Sometimes the project team needs to run only a few &ldquo;hotspot&rdquo; test cases that are flaky during regression test and want to save effort and resources at the same time. It is now possible in Katalon Studio v5.10. In Test Listener, simply call skipThisTestCase() method to skip any Test Case that satisfied the condition. Skipped Test Case will have the status as **SKIPPED** in test execution result
