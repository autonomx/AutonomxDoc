Cucumber Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Testing Support
----------------------------------------------------------

Katalon Studio 5.7 introduces all-new BDD testing capability allowing Business stakeholders to get involved in the testing process. Tests can be defined in the simple spoken language instead of technical language, called Gherkin. The product team members can start writing test cases as specifications in Katalon Studio and the development team can pick-up right after, a more efficient development life cycle. Thus, the project team will have a better understanding of the requirements and also promote collaboration between the business stakeholders and the rest of the team. 

_**Key Features**_

*   Feature files are stored and displayed in Katalon Studio project structure
*   Step definitions are implemented in Script Mode with hundreds of built-in keyword for reusability
*   Easy-to-manage Feature files as Katalon Studio test artifacts structure

Smart XPath Generator
---------------------

Most Web UI tests fail because the elements cannot be located in the application under test. Katalon Studio 5.7 offers a new object selector, **_Relative XPath_** to help increase the possibility of successfully identifying an object. The new improved Record Web Utility has also been equipped with better record engine. This makes Katalon Studio more responsive to users' actions, ensuring every key action is captured.

_**Key Features**_

*   Locates Web elements by clustering visualization.
*   Preserves the relationship between an element and its indicator in an item. 
*   Generates reliable locators to reduce test script maintenance cost.

Support variables for API Testing
---------------------------------

Adding a **Variables** tab to the Web Service Object details view to further supports parameterization, making the API Testing process easier. Pre-defined variables will be mapped **automatically** when selecting Web Service object from Manual Mode, so the users don't need to define them again manually, cutting down the chance of missing requirement variables.
