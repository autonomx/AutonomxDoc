In these two videos, we will discuss how we can work with parameterized custom test object in Katalon Studio.

We will also learn how to:  
1\. Work with modifying existing Object Repo Test Object.  
2\. Adding all new custom object and setting a single property.  
3\. Adding new custom object and setting multiple lists of properties.  
4\. Getting a value or name out from a property during runtime.
