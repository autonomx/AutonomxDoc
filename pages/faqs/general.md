### Q: How is Katalon Studio different from Selenium or Appium? 
------------------------------------------------------------

Katalon Studio is a simple and powerful test automation tool. It was built on top of Selenium and Appium framework. Katalon Studio allows users with less experience in programming background to work effortlessly by providing a predefined automation framework with hundreds of built-in keywords. Users can also leverage Record and Spy feature to capture objects and generate test scripts quickly.

### Q: Why should I choose Katalon Studio instead of other open-source frameworks?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Katalon Studio is built on top of open-source framework Selenium and Appium and out-of-the-box ready to use with multiple integrations such as qTest, JIRA, GIT, etc. Users do not have to design and implement the frameworks. Katalon Studio takes all advantages of these open-source frameworks and provides advanced capabilities for test automation. On top of that, Katalon Studio was designed with Object Repository for better objects management and maintenance. At the same time, the object reusability can be achieved. One of the most exciting features of Katalon Studio is Spy and Record. It was developed to detect and capture dynamic elements intelligently, and also generate test scripts automatically.
