### Q: How do I deal with objects that can't be handled by Katalon Studio?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are situations in which Katalon Studio cannot interact with certain objects in AUT.

You can use the Built-in Keyword Verify Image Present to validate the objects that cannot be interacted.
