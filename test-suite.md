# Test Suite

## Purpose

* Test suites allow for running a collection of tests
* The tests are defined in XML format
* We can use test suites to create test collection:
  * Sanity tests: a basic test to quickly evaluate whether the application is functional
  * Smoke tests: is performed after a software build to ascertain that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine. It is executed "before" any detailed functional or regression tests are executed on the software build
  * Regression tests: testing all existing features
