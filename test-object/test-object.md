# Test Object

## Purpose

* Test objects are used to handle test data
* Handling test data in an object allows for a simple way of adding, passing and modifying data associated with tests
* Example: user info data. User info can contain the basic username and password, however, this can grow as the project grows. Using data objects, allows additional of info such as "user id" to be added without changing the dynamics of the methods where user info is used
