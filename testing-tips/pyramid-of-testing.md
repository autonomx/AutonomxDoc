# Pyramid Of Testing

Testing pyramid refers to having high number of low level tests, medium number of integration tests and low number of UI/Gui tests

* The testing pyramid is a concept that can help you better balance your tests, speeding up your test suite and reducing the cost of changing the functionality of your applications
* This means that we dont want to focus mainly on UI level automation, rather we want to focus on Service level tests \(api, database, integration, component\) tests to cover majority of the logic and requirements
* UI level testing will be left to high level and end to end testing
