# Test Panel



## Purpose

* Test panel follows the page object model, where the page \(panel\) contains the element locators and actions associated with a page.
* It is called Panel, because it's applicable to more than just web pages, including mobile app panels, and sections of pages \(eg. side bar\). Hence, the name Panel is a more comprehensive.

## Structure

* Panel compromises of 3 parts: Constructor, Locator, and Action
* On compile, panel manager is generated using Java annotations
* The panel manager takes care of linking the panels, so they can interact with one another
